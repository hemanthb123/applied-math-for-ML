# Short Course on Applied Math for Machine Learning

Course goals: Many students lack the appropriate applied math background for understanding and applying popular machine learning algorithms. The topics that we cover here are foundational to most (all?) modern machine learning topics. This course aims to not be proof-heavy and mathematically rigorous: focus on practical examples applied computationally. We will illustrate these topics with not just in the language of mathematics, but also NumPy. This will bring the power of these topics to the student's fingertips for immediate application in practical numerical analysis, data science, and machine learning. 

Suggested background: familiarity with python or another high level scripting language


*Each lecture is presented as a Jupyter Notebook. We assume the computing Python distribution from Anaconda. *
